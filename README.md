## Grading

There will be 2 laboratory tests, one about Data Structures and one about Algorithms.

Each test will count as 35% from the final LAB_GRADE.
The remaning 30% will be calculated based on your input during the semester (Pull Requests with what you've worked and ACTIVITY_POINTS based on how active you are during lab sessions).

LAB_GRADE is 35% out of the final grade.

Each lab will have proposed problems which you will have to solve and upload it on git.

* There will be "extra credit" assignments that can only be completed by those who already have completed the "normal" assignments. These will be even more thoroughly inspected and evaluated.

### About tests

* Check "Algorithms exam" and "Data Structures exam" folders to see the format
* Code does not even compile: 1 (by default, no excuses)
* Cheating attempts: 1 (by default, no excuses)

### Administrative

* Max number of absences = 1 (NOT applicable for test days - if you miss a test day, you'll have to take the test separately, problem will be more difficult)
