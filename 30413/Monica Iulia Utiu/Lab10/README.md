# Lab 10

> I wanted to declare the variables globally, altough in our case it would be easy without them too.
  I created a utility function for the minimum of 3 values and a function that generates the lowest cost path matrix from mat[1][1] to every cell.
  The result for the problem will be stored in DP[n][m] for an nxm matrix.
  I had an issue, my program doesn't wanna print anything after calling the LowCostMatrix function.
