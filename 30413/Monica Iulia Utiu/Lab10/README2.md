# Lab 10 hw

 >I tried two ways of solving this problem, starting from the first character (function DP) or the last character (function DP2).
  The first one didnt pass al my tests that's why i started the second, that at least from my tests, is correct.
  I declared the array globally and I realized midway that i cant initialize it all with {-1} so i did that in the main with 2 for loops.
