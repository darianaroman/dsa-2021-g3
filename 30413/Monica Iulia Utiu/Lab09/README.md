# Lab 09

> For 9.3.1 firstly, i created two utility functions max2 and max3 to use for the max sum functions.
There is a max crossing sum function created to use for the overall max sum in the array. 
I left the reading from keyboard because I like the option of verifying different types of strings and having them in front of me.
