# Lab 10

> In this Lab we learned about dynamic programming and about memorization.
During this lab work I solved a problem in which I had to find the minimum path between two points in a matrix.
For this, I used an auxiliary matrix (aux) and i filled each of its cells with the cost of the minimum path until that cell.
