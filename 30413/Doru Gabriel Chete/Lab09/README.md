# Lab 09

> In this lab I learned more about the famous Divide et Impera algorithm, and though I was familiar with it from high school, I did learn some
new things, particularily some more situations when it could potentially be useful. For problem 9.3.1 I wrote a function that operates on a vector
and is given 2 parameters, the left index bound and the right index bound. For these two, it will truncate the segment of the vector in 2, calculate
the maximum value for both sides (left and right) and then put them together. The function computers recursively the maximum sums for all subarrays 
and returns the one with the largest sum. I also wrote a simple function that computes the maximum of two integers.
