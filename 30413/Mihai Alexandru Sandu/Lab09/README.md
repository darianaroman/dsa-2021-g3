# Lab 09

> In this lab I learned how divide and conquer works, and we also implemented an algorithm using this technique, more specific, we implemented a merge sort algorithm.
> HOW I SOLVED THE EXTRA:

First, I implemented the towers of Hanoi problem normaly, recursively, and I added on top of that some extra functions.
I considered the towers to be stacks, so I implemented stacks and pop and push operations.
Then, In every step of the algorithm, I also moved the disks on the specific stack, and displayed all the towers.
