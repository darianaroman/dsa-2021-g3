# Lab 09

	In this lab we looked over the Divide et Impera method, which we learned in highschool. It was nice to
	refresh the knowledge about this algorithm and I even learned some new things.
	We had to solve the common problem of finding the biggest subarray sum in an array and also 
	the famous Towers of Hanoi problem.
