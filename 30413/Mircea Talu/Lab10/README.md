# Lab 10

	In this lab we learnt about interesting topics such as dynamic programming and hereuristics.
	Then, we had to solve a difficult problem about an array and two natural numbers.
	I did think a lot for this problem and I tried many things, such as the Subset Sum Problem, but with negative numbers too.
	I realized that this would be too hard to implement and also pretty useless, because we can use the same values multiple times,
	unlike the classic Subset problem. I liked working for this problem, because I learnt some new things about this kind of problems
	while searching for solutions.
