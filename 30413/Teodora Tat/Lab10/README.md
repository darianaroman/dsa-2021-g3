# Lab 10
In this lab I learned about dinamic programming. I saw first how to solve the Fibonacci array problem with dinamic programming, then I received a task to solve the minimum path in a matrix.
In the problem I calculated at every position the minimum path until that position : firstly I created a minimum function which I used for finding the smallest neighbour of the position I am at to help adding it to the value of that position so that I will have the shortest path (in the function I calculated separately the minimum path for the first line and column).
For the homework I used a variable m to store the number I have to add or substract from nr A to get to B (when m turns 0 in the problem, then it stops), then I tried to obtain it by searching in the array (which I sorted increasively to search easily) only by the smaler and closest value to m( because I only substract from m, it doesn't make sense to substract something bigger) so I go decreasingly from the biggest value and at the same time from the smallest to try and find the smallest nr of operations ( I don't think it's the optimal way to solve the problem but what I've tried was to go from the smallest nr of operations increasively until I find a way to get to the number B).
