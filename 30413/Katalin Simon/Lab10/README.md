>i have absolutely no clue how to solve 10.x.4 problem, my idea was to work with absolute values and subtract values from the given abs values and abs(A-B), then keep trace of how many times was a number extracted. Another idea was to verify if the 1 element does the job of them all, then if 2 do, and so on, But i found mistakes in every theory I made up
