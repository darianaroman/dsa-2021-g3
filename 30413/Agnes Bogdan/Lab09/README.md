# Lab 09

I read the array from a text file and wrote a function to check which is the maximal sum of a subarray.
I used a variable which hold the temporary value of the maximal sum. First I initialized it, so it had the value of the first element of the array,
as well as the maximum variable itself. After that in a for loop, starting from the second element of the array i checked if the sum of the
previous temporary maximum and the number with index 'i' is greater than that value, if yes i changed the temporary maximum's value. if this was
greater than the actual maximum i changed that too. at the end of the function i printed out the answer on the screen.
