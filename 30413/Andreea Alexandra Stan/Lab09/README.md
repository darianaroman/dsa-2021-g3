# Lab 9

> Edit this file and describe in a few words what you've done in this lab.
During this lab we discussed about divide et impera. Then, as an example, we implemented a mergesort function

To solve the mandatory problem, I used the divide et impera strategy. I divide the array into 2 other subarays, then checked three cases: if the maximum sum is in the left subarray, in the right one or contains elements from both parts.

For the extra problem, I used a recursive function and a singly linked list(actually a stack) to store the disk of each peg.
